# ReadMe.API
Node API for ReadMe app. Please refer to our [project](https://github.com/foscjos/ReadMe.UI/projects/1) for a current list of in-progress tasks.

To run this server, run the commands 'npm install' and then 'npm start'. The server runs on port 3001 by default. 

If you want to contribute to this project, please create a fork of the repo, and commit to our main branch. Pull requests will be reviewed on a regular basis.

Things you will need to do to run locally: 
Run a general npm install

Run npm install mongodb --save (may not need this step if I set up packages correctly)

npm install mongoose --save (again, may not need if I set things up correctly)

See if you can hit the healthcheck endpoint

Pull  in my environment variable since that cannot be checked into git (text me)

For now we will use postman to test api routes, but once we build out the UI we will need to do this less
